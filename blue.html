		<h1>Study for tests</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
		Don't wait for the last minute to cram for a test, make enough time to study. If 
		you get distracted easily then block the applications that distract you and then 
		unblock it when you are done.
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Ways to study</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Review Material Frequently</li>
			<p>The first review should come very shortly after the material was first 
			presented and studied. </p>
			<hr>
			<li>Rewrite notes</li>
			<p>Don't waste time doing something in class that you can figure out or neaten 
			up at home.Rewrite your notes as soon after the class as possible, while the 
			material is fresh in your mind so that you can fill in any gaps completely 
			from memory. </p>
			<hr>
			<li>Make flashcards</li>
			<p>Put the questions on the side you can see when the paper is folded; unfold 
			it to see the answers inside. Keep quizzing yourself until you get all the 
			answers right reliably.</p>
			<hr>
			<li>Clear your mind before studying</li>
			<p>If youâ€™ve got a lot on your mind take a moment to write yourself some notes
			 about what you're thinking about before you start studying.</p>
			 <hr>
			<li>Take good notes</li>
			<p>Learn to take good notes efficiently as your instructors stress important
			 points in class and as you study your assignments. Without notes, you will 
			 need to reread and review the entire assignment before a test. With notes, 
			 you can recall the main points in just a fraction of the time.</p>
