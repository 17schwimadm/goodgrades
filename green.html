	<h1>Turn in Assignments</h1>

	 <p><b>	
		When teachers give out assignments, make sure you finish them and turn them
		in for credit. Try your hardest to finish each and every assignment your teacher 
		hands out. 
	 </b></P>
		<hr>
	<h2>1: Get Organized!</h2>

	 <p><b>
		Get a folder for each class to put your assignments in. 
		Folders are very helpful. You do not 
		want to get zeros for losing your assignments in a messy backpack.  
	 </b></p>
	 <hr>
	 <h3>2: Listen!</h3>
	 
	 <p><b> When a teacher is teaching you on how to do the assignment, LISTEN! Don't let
	 other students distract you! </b></p>
	 <hr>
	 <h4>3: Get your assignments done early!</h4>
	 <p><b> Try and Get every assignment done early. You don't want to be rushing to get your 
	     assignment done in class when you could've had it done the other day. </b></P>
	     <hr>
