	<h1>Finish and turn in your homework.</h1>
	
	<p>	
		When teachers give out assignments, make sure you finish them and turn them
		in for credit. Try your hardest to finish each and every assignment your teacher 
		hands out. 
	</P>

	<p>
		Be organized! Get a folder for each class to put your assignments in. 
		Folders are very helpful. You do not 
		want to get zeros for losing your assignments in a messy backpack.
