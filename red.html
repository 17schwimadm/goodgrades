		<h1>Ask Questions</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
		If you don't understand what the teacher is teaching ask questions or ask how to 
		solve a problem.  
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Why you should ask questions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>To be more engaged with the material.</li>
			<p>You will understand better and be able to follow along with the teacher if 
			you know what they are talking about. Also, even if everyone else 
			thinks that they know the answer, the teacher may give a slightly different 
			answer, inspiring additional thoughts that helps others in the class </p>
			<hr>
			<li>To enhance your understanding.</li>
			<p>If you don't understand ask a question to help you understand. Once you 
			understand you will be able to do any homework that you might have on it. If 
			you will benefit from it, then at least 5 other people will also benefit from 
			it, whether or not they realize it at that time. . </p>
			<hr>
			<li>To get credit (in a class that gives participation credit) and to create 
			a favorable impression with the teacher.</li>
			<p>Teachers want to know that you understand and that you are there to learn. 
			Sometimes teachers don't always communicate clearly so asking questions will 
			show that the teacher needs to cover part of their lesson better. </p>
			<hr>
